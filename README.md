### How to add multiple students to a class

When on a class's page, the default option is to add one student at a time. If you want to add multiple students:

1. Select "Add multiple students"
2. Type/paste student names into the text box
3. Select a format (one name per line, or names separated by commas)
4. Select "Add all"

### How to rename a class

The extension does not currently allow you to rename existing classes. However, you can accomplish the same thing by following these steps:

1. Create a new class with the desired name
2. Select "Copy another class?"
3. Select the original class
4. Delete the original class
